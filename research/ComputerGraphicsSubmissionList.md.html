This document contains a comprehensive list of (currently active) annual international events and premier publishers of science and technology resources.
It is to be used to guide each of us (researchers!) as we find our way to submit a '_computer graphics_' technical article or demonstration. Note that this is a living document; I hope to keep it periodically updated in order to ensure up-to-date information. Last but not least, if I’ve missed/misplaced anything, please do not hesitate to correct me via [email](abasilak@iti.gr) or [twitter]("https://twitter.com/abasilak").
